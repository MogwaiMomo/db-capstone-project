# IMPORTANT NOTE: 

Please note that the following 2 files: 

- LittleLemonDM.png
- LittleLemonDBSchemaOnly.sql

Reflect the fully normalized database that SHOULD have been created based on the instructions from Week 1. 

However, because the actual Excel data given to query does not include all of the attributes that were laid out in Week 1, the schema of the populated DB that most of the project is based on (LittleLemonDB.sql) is different from these files.
